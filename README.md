# TarGuess-I
Code for our 2016 ACM CCS Paper "Targeted Online Password Guessing: An Underestimated Threat"

We do not upload the source files including personal identifiable information, treating each individual account as confidential, stroing and processing them on computers not linked to the Internet.

While these datasets might be already explited by attackers for misconduct, our use is helpful for security administrators/users to measure password strength and prevent weak ones.

### Research Paper

The paper is available at the [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2976749.2978339).
